Accurate-Cyber-Defense-Network-Intelligence-Bot (ACD-NIB) is an advanced cybersecurity solution designed to deliver real-time threat detection, network surveillance, and intelligent alerting through seamless Telegram integration. 
Built using Python and designed for deployment on platforms like PythonAnywhere, this bot acts as an autonomous digital sentinel, constantly analyzing network traffic, 
identifying anomalies, and preventing potential intrusions before they escalate.

At its core, ACD-NIB leverages intelligent traffic monitoring, behavior analysis, and heuristic scanning to spot suspicious activities, malware signatures, 
and unauthorized access attempts across local or cloud-hosted infrastructures. It utilizes packet sniffing, DNS tracking, port scanning, and protocol 
fingerprinting to gather live intelligence about the state of the network.

The bot supports instant notifications via Telegram, allowing cybersecurity teams or solo administrators to receive critical alerts, log summaries, and incident reports directly 
to their mobile devices or desktops. 
Telegram integration also enables remote commands—such as querying traffic logs, isolating suspicious IPs, or restarting scans—giving admins hands-on control even while on the move.

In addition to intrusion detection, ACD-NIB features a lightweight threat intelligence module that correlates traffic behavior with known threat databases, f
lagging botnet traffic, phishing links, brute-force attempts, and more. 
All findings are logged in a secure SQLite or cloud-based database for later analysis or forensic investigations.

ACD-NIB can be deployed in academic institutions, startups, enterprise networks, or home labs, 
and supports modular enhancements such as AI-driven threat scoring, email alerts, and advanced encryption.

In summary, ACD-NIB is a reliable, scalable, and intelligent network defense companion—blending automation, real-time intelligence, 
and user-friendly integration to make cybersecurity more proactive and accessible to everyone.
